Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

This repository contains a R script, named run\_analysis.R, that was developed to obtain the data and produce a tidy data-set.

You will also find the CodeBook that will describe the data in the tidy data-set.

##Instructions to run the *run_analysis.R*
1. Obtain the data-set from: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Unzip it in the same directory(working directory) where the run\_analysis.R script resides.
3. Run the *run\_analysis.R* script. The script will generate 2 files:
	* merged\_dataset.txt - the first required data-set of the Project
	* tidy\_dataset.txt - second required data-set output of the Project
